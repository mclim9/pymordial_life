MacOS Requirements
------------------

`pygame` requires external c/c++ libraries. When installing from pip, these dependencies must be met beforehand.

Using [homebrew](https://brew.sh):

`brew install brew install sdl sdl_image sdl_mixer sdl_ttf smpeg portmidi`

Then you can install python dependencies as usual:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
